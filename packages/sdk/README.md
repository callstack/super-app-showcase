# Super App Showcase SDK

SDK for the [Super App Showcase](https://github.com/callstack/super-app-showcase).

It's purpose is three-fold:

- serve as source of truth for dependencies & dev-dependencies necessary for compatibility with the super-app
- provide utilities to use these dependencies easily in other workspaces & external repositories (`news-mini-app`)
- remove the necessity of keeping `shared` dependencies in-sync manually by automating the process
